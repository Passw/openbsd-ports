Atuin replaces your existing shell history with a SQLite database, and records
additional context for your commands. With this context, Atuin gives you faster
and better search of your shell history.

Additionally, Atuin (optionally) syncs your shell history between all of your
machines. Fully end-to-end encrypted.
