whisper.cpp requires use of an AI model for operation. This package
bundles a base model for transcription that was trained on English
source material (ggml-base.en).

Other models provide higher accuracy at the expense of increased use
of resources, and there's a choice of multilingual or English-only
source material (for the smaller models, English-only tends to give
better results on English input - for medium/large, multilingual
may work better - test with your typical source material).

A download script, whisper.cpp-download-ggml-model, is provided.

To list available downloads:
$ whisper.cpp-download-ggml-model

To fetch the multilingual medium model:
$ whisper.cpp-download-ggml-model medium

Files fetched in this way can be used by passing the -m flag:
$ whisper-cli -m ggml-base.bin -t {threads} -f {sample}.wav

whisper-cli defaults to English; specify a language (fr, cy,  eu, ...)
or "auto" with the -l flag. See https://whisper-api.com/docs/languages/
