The sndiortp utility can record audio from a sndio(7) audio device and send it
on the network over RTP. Similarly it can receive audio streams over RTP and
play the result on the device.

This utility is mainly intended to test RTP capable audio equipment but
it may also be used to broadcast audio over a fast local area network.
