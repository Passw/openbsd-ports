XXX c/p from x11/gtk+3, does it still work?

Themes
======

Default
-------
The default GTK+ theme engine can be modified by editing:
    ~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini
and appending a line similar to:
gtk-theme-name = oxygen-gtk

Extras
------
Some themes are available as packages ("gtk4-*-engine").

Printing
========

Preview
-------
By default, GTK+ uses the papers-previewer ("gnome-papers" package) or
evince-previewer ("evince" package) command to display a "Print Preview".
This can be modified by editing:
    ~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini
and appending the following line:
gtk-print-preview-command = epdfview %f

(epdfview can be replaced by any other PDF viewer command like xpdf...)

Note that by default, gnome-papers and evince will remove the temporary PDF
preview file (/tmp/previewXXXXXX.pdf) when done, that might not be the case with
other PDF viewers.
