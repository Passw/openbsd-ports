DuckDB is a high-performance analytical database system. It is designed to be
fast, reliable, portable, and easy to use. DuckDB provides a rich SQL dialect,
with support far beyond basic SQL. DuckDB supports arbitrary and nested
correlated subqueries, window functions, collations, complex types (arrays,
structs, maps), and several extensions designed to make SQL easier to use.
