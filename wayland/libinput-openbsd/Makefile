# XXX
# libinput-openbsd is not feature complete that the input works
# in a usable way in Wayland. There is still too little experience here.
# In the following ports libinput detection was deactivated
# audio/pulseaudio
# devel/sdl2
# games/bzflag
# graphics/gimp/stable
# misc/brltty
# sysutils/consolekit
# wayland/libei
# x11/gnome/mutter
# x11/gtk+3 (-Dwayland-backend=false)
# x11/gtk+4 (-Dwayland-backend=false)
