Cage is a kiosk compositor for Wayland. A kiosk is a window manager
(in the X11 world) or compositor (in the Wayland world) that is
designed for a user experience wherein user interaction and activities
outside the scope of the running application are prevented. That is, a
kiosk compositor displays a single maximized application at a time and
prevents the user from interacting with anything but this application.

Cage runs a single, maximized application. Cage can run multiple
applications, but only a single one is visible at any point in
time. User interaction and activities outside the scope of the running
application are prevented.

Cage supports multiple outputs. It supports hotplugging additional
outputs and exits when its last output is removed. Cage defaults to
the outputs' preferred modes and supports (static, i.e. specified on
startup) output rotation. Cage does not support output layout
configuration
