Wayback is a X11 compatibility layer which allows for running full X11
desktop environments using Wayland components. It is essentially a
stub compositor which provides just enough Wayland capabilities to
host a rootful Xwayland server.

It is intended to eventually replace the classic X.Org server, thus
reducing maintenance burden of X11 applications, but a lot of work
needs to be done first.

Wayback is an experimental state: expect breaking changes, and lots of
bugs.

To run wayback on OpenBSD use a wrapper like this one:

#! /bin/ksh
set -eu

: ${WLR_DRM_DEVICES:=/dev/dri/card0}
: ${LIBSEAT_BACKEND:=noop}
: ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:=${HOME}/.local/run}

export WLR_DRM_DEVICES LIBSEAT_BACKEND XDG_RUNTIME_DIR

if [ ! -d $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR ]; then
    mkdir -m 700 -p $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
fi

exec ${PREFIX}/bin/wayback-session $*
