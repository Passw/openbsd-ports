Snapshots tests (also sometimes called approval tests) are tests that
assert values against a reference value (the snapshot). This is similar
to how assert_eq! lets you compare a value against a reference value but
unlike simple string assertions, snapshot tests let you test against
complex values and come with comprehensive tools to review changes.
