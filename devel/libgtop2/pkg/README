To access some system information, libgtop_server2 needs to read physical
and/or kernel virtual memory.
As mentioned in mem(4) and kmem(4):
     Even with sufficient file system permissions, these devices can only be
     opened when the securelevel(7) is insecure or when the kern.allowkmem
     sysctl(2) variable is set.
 
!!! Setting this sysctl(2) is strongly discouraged, unless for debugging !!!

It is *NOT* mandatory for proper day-to-day usage of libgtop and will only yield
the following warning:
    kvm_nlist: Bad file descriptor
