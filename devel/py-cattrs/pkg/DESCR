cattrs is a Swiss army knife for structuring and validating data
in Python. In practice, that means it converts unstructured
dictionaries into proper classes and back, while validating their
contents.

cattrs works best with attrs classes, and dataclasses where simple
structuring works out of the box, even for nested data, without
polluting your data model with serialization details.
