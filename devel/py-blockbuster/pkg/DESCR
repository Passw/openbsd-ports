Blockbuster is a Python package designed to detect and prevent blocking
calls within an asynchronous event loop. It is particularly useful
when executing tests to ensure that your asynchronous code does not
inadvertently call blocking operations, which can lead to performance
bottlenecks and unpredictable behavior.
