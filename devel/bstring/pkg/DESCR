The bstring library is an attempt to provide improved string processing
functionality to the C language. At the heart of the bstring library (Bstrlib
for short) is the management of bstrings which are a significant improvement
over NULL terminated char buffers.

This is a fork of Paul Hsieh's Better String Library:
