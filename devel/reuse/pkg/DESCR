reuse is a tool for compliance with the REUSE recommendations.

Copyright and licensing is difficult, especially when reusing software from
different projects that are released under various different licenses. REUSE was
started by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) to provide a set of
recommendations to make licensing your Free Software projects easier. Not only
do these recommendations make it easier for you to declare the licenses under
which your works are released, but they also make it easier for a computer to
understand how your project is licensed.
