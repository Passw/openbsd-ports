goat is a command-line client for AT Protocol ("Authenticated Transfer
Protocol"). The AT Protocol is an open, decentralized network for building
social applications, best known for its use by Bluesky.

Most commands use public APIs and don't require authentication. Some commands,
like creating records, require an atproto account. You can log in using an "app

- Resolve an account's identity in the network
- List record collection types for an account
- Fetch a record from the network as JSON
- Make a public snapshot of account
- Show PLC history
- Verify syntax and generate TIDs
- Post record (minimal, requires account login)
