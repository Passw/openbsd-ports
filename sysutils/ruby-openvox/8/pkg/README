Package handling
================

Support for specifying versions or latest was dropped, in favor of supporting
package branches.

To install a package of a given branch, you have to suffix the package name
with %branch name. For example to ensure OpenVox 8 is installed:

package { 'openvox%8':
	ensure => 'present'
}
