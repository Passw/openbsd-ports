Optional packages endowing PARI with extra capabilities.

- elldata: PARI version of the Elliptic curve data by J. E. Cremona,

  ellsearch, ellidentity and ellgenerators.

- galdata: data needed by polgalois for degrees 8,9,10 and 11

- galpol: PARI package of the GALPOL database of polynomials defining
  Galois extensions of the rationals, accessed by galoisgetpol.

- nftables: repackaging of the historical 'megrez' number field tables

- seadata: needed by ellap for large primes. These polynomials were
  extracted from the ECHIDNA databases and computed by David R. Kohel.
