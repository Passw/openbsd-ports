Some calendar creators such as Google Calendar introduce the
non-standard X-WR-TIMEZONE parameter to ICS calendar files to change
the timezone. Strict interpretations according to RFC 5545 ignore
the X-WR-TIMEZONE parameter. This causes the times of the events
to differ from those which make use of X-WR-TIMEZONE. This module
aims to bridge the gap by converting calendars using X-WR-TIMEZONE
to a strict RFC 5545 calendars.
