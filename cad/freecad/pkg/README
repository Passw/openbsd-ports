Some CAD operations may require large amounts of memory that exceed the limits
set by the user's default login class. This can cause FreeCAD to crash. To
avoid this, increase datasize memory limits in ${SYSCONFDIR}/login.conf or make
sure your user is in the 'staff' class, and bump the limits with 'ulimit'.
