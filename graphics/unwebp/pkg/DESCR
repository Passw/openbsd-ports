unwebp is a simple script to get rid of google new image format,
by converting it back to something decent like gif or png that can
be read outside of a browser.

Unsurprisingly, libwebp only offers support into webp, not for converting
things back to gifs.

Note that the conversion to mp4 needs ffmpeg as an (optional)
run-time dependency
