Most "typewriter" fonts are unrealistic: each instance of a particular
letter looks identical. In text produced by a real typewriter, characters
vary with each press of the key.

TT2020 mimics the appearance of typewritten text in a novel way: the font
contains nine slightly different copies of each glyph, and (when used in a
modern font layout engine) selects one of these copies in a pseudorandom
fashion using OpenType's "contextual alternates" feature.

TT2020 is also multilingual, providing Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, and Hebrew
characters, as well as italic variants.
