Nerd Fonts is a project that patches developer targeted fonts with a
high number of glyphs (icons). Specifically to add a high number of
extra glyphs from popular 'iconic fonts' such as Font Awesome, Devicons,
Octicons, and others. The font patcher utility is not included in this
package.

This package is a patched version of the Intel One Mono font, renamed
IntoneMono to comply with the SIL Open Font License 'Reserved Font Name
mechanism'.
