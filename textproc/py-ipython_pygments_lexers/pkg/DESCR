IPython is an interactive Python shell. Among other features, it
adds some special convenience syntax, including "%magics", "!shell
commands" and "help?". This package contains lexers for these, to
use with the Pygments syntax highlighting package.

- The "ipython" lexer should be used where only input code is
  highlighted
- The "ipythonconsole" lexer works for an IPython session,
  including code, prompts, output and tracebacks.

These lexers were previously part of IPython itself, but have now
been moved to a separate package.
