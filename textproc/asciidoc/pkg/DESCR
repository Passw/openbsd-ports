AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation,
articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, man pages and blogs.
AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats including HTML, PDF,
EPUB, man page.

AsciiDoc is highly configurable: both the AsciiDoc source file syntax
and the backend output markups (which can be almost any type of
SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended by the user.

This package provides AsciiDoc.py, a legacy processor for an older
rendition of the AsciiDoc syntax. As such, it will not properly handle
the language that is being described by AsciiDoc specification,
however some software depends on this toolchain.

For the most common processor for the current version of the language,
see the asciidoctor package.
