| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

dnscrypt-proxy listens for DNS queries on a local address and forwards
them to a DNSCrypt resolver over an encrypted channel.

To use this package, several things are required.

Customizing dnscrypt-proxy.toml
===============================

Ensure that ${SYSCONFDIR}/dnscrypt-proxy.toml fits your needs.

Resolvers
---------
Uncomment 'server_names' to have a smaller set of public resolvers to be used
for load balancing. If this line is commented, all registered servers matching
the require_* filters will be used for load balancing. Refer to
${LOCALSTATEDIR}/dnscrypt-proxy/public-resolvers.md for a list of all public
resolvers.

Load balancing strategy
-----------------------
Note the load balancing strategy, controlled by 'lb_strategy'. It can be
set to one of the following values:
  - 'wp2' (default): Weighted Power of Two - selects the better
    performing server from two random candidates based on real-time RTT
    and success rates.
  - 'p2': Randomly choose 1 of the fastest 2 servers by latency.
  - 'ph': Randomly choose from fastest half of servers.
  - 'p<n>': Randomly choose from fastest n servers (e.g., 'p3' for fastest 3).
  - 'first': Always use the fastest server.
  - 'random': Randomly choose from all servers.

https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Load-Balancing-Options

Logging
-------
Logging is disabled by default.

To log to ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/log/messages:
log_level = 2
use_syslog = true

To log to a custom file:
log_level = 2
log_file = '${LOCALSTATEDIR}/log/dnscrypt-proxy.log'

Daemon
======

Start the daemon:

# rcctl enable dnscrypt_proxy
# rcctl start dnscrypt_proxy

resolv.conf
===========

Managed by resolvd(8). One way is to disable it and force
${SYSCONFDIR}/resolv.conf to perform queries from dnscrypt-proxy:

nameserver 127.0.0.1
lookup file bind
