aiomqtt is an idiomatic asyncio MQTT client for Python. It supports MQTT
versions 3.1, 3.1.1 and 5.0 via paho-mqtt, handles disconnection gracefully,
is fully type-hinted, and client code is simple (callbacks are not needed):

Publish:

async with Client("test.mosquitto.org") as client:
    await client.publish("temperature/outside", payload=28.4)

Subscribe:

async with Client("test.mosquitto.org") as client:
    await client.subscribe("temperature/#")
    async for message in client.messages:
        print(message.payload)
