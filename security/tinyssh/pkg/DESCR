tinysshd is a minimalistic SSH server which implements only a subset
of SSHv2 features.

It supports only secure cryptography (minimum 128-bit security,
protected against cache-timing attacks) and does not implement older
crypto (such as RSA, DSA, HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1, 3DES, RC4, ...)

tinysshd doesn't implement unsafe features (such as password or
hostbased authentication), nor does it have features like SSH1 protocol,
compression, port forwarding, agent forwarding, X11 forwarding ...

It does not listen to network sockets itself, and should be run
from inetd, tcpserver or similar.

tinysshd doesn't use dynamic memory allocation.
